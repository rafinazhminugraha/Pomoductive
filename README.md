## Architecture

### Timer Logic (`useTimer` hook)
The timer uses React state and `setInterval` for accurate countdown:

1. **State Management**: Tracks `timerState` (idle/focus/break), `timerStatus` (idle/running/paused), and `timeRemaining`
2. **Automatic Transitions**: When focus completes → auto-starts break; when break completes → auto-starts focus
3. **Session Tracking**: Increments session count after each focus completion
4. **Audio Coordination**: Plays appropriate music and alarms at state changes

### Audio Playback (`useAudio` hook)
- Creates `HTMLAudioElement` instances on mount
- Music loops continuously during sessions
- Alarms are one-shot sounds at transitions
- Graceful handling of browser autoplay restrictions

### Component Responsibilities
- **TimerDisplay**: Visual countdown with SVG progress ring
- **TimerControls**: Dynamic button states based on timer status
- **ModeSelector**: Template cards + custom duration inputs
- **SessionCounter**: Progress dots + motivational feedback

## Design Decisions

### Why This Aesthetic?
- **Dark theme**: Reduces eye strain during long focus sessions
- **Subtle gradients**: Rose for focus (energizing), Emerald for break (calming)
- **Minimal chrome**: Nothing to distract from the task at hand
- **Large timer**: Primary focus element, easy to glance at

### UX Principles Applied
- **Zero confusion**: Clear state indicators, obvious primary action
- **Calm transitions**: Smooth animations that don't jar attention
- **Progressive disclosure**: Mode selector fades when timer is active
- **Feedback everywhere**: Visual confirmation for all interactions
